==================================================================================

This script:

-retrieves a list of nodes from Solus
-retrieves a list of IPs by node from Solus
-on a per-IP basis, interfaces with the WHMCS DB to determine if WHMCS knows about
 the IP address
-generates a list of IPs that are not in WHMCS

==================================================================================

Requirements:

PHP 5.2+ (untested on older versions)
PHP PDO
PHP cURL

==================================================================================

It's recommended to run it on the same machine as your WHMCS installation, as
most MySQL installations are set to not be internet-accessible.

To set it up, edit the following variables in checkips.php:

$API_url 	- URL for Solus API
$API_id 	- ID for Solus API
$API_key	- key for Solus API

$db_database 		- your WHMCS database
$db_user		- a database user that has SELECT capability for your WHMCS database
$db_password		- database user's password
$db_host = "localhost"; - probably 'localhost', change if you know it needs to be changed
$db_charset = "latin1"; - our WHMCS database' charset is latin1, not sure if this is default or what

Then save checkips.php, exit your editor, and invoke with:

php checkips.php
